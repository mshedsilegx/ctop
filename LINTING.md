### Code Review Summary

The work was divided into two main tasks, both aimed at improving code quality and correctness by addressing static analysis findings.

---

#### Task 1: Fix `go vet` Issues

*   **Goal:** Address all issues reported by the `go vet ./...` command.
*   **Files Changed:** `main.go`, `menus.go`.
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    1.  **`main.go`:** Removed unreachable `fmt.Printf` and `os.Exit` calls from the `panicExit` function. These lines were placed after a `panic(r)` call, which guarantees they would never be executed.
    2.  **`menus.go`:** Converted all unkeyed `menu.Item` struct literals (e.g., `menu.Item{"value", "label"}`) to keyed literals (e.g., `menu.Item{Val: "value", Label: "label"}`).
*   **Accuracy and Completeness:**
    *   The changes are **accurate**. Removing unreachable code is a standard cleanup, and converting to keyed literals is a Go best practice for readability and maintainability.
    *   The task was **complete**. After the changes, `go vet ./...` ran successfully with no output, confirming all reported issues were resolved.

#### Task 2: Fix `golangci-lint` Issues

*   **Goal:** Address all 51 issues reported by `golangci-lint run ./...` without performing any module updates.
*   **Files Changed:** Numerous files across the `connector`, `cwidgets`, `config`, `logging`, and `widgets` packages.
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    1.  **Error Handling (`errcheck`):** Added error handling for 9 function calls where the error return value was previously ignored. The standard practice applied was to log the error.
    2.  **Deprecation & Modernization (`govet`, `staticcheck`):**
        *   Replaced deprecated `// +build` directives with the modern `//go:build` syntax.
        *   Replaced the deprecated `io/ioutil` package with the `os` package for reading directories.
        *   Updated deprecated function calls, most notably `rand.Seed`, to use the modern approach of creating a local `rand.New(rand.NewSource(...))` generator.
        *   Updated deprecated Docker client methods to their current equivalents (e.g., `InspectContainer` to `InspectContainerWithOptions`).
    3.  **Code Correctness (`staticcheck`):**
        *   Fixed a bug in `cwidgets/single/hist.go` where the `Append` method for `FloatHist` used a value receiver instead of a pointer receiver, causing state modifications to be lost.
        *   Fixed an ineffective `break` statement within a `select` block by using a labeled `break` to exit the parent `for` loop correctly.
    4.  **Unused Code (`unused`):** Removed 14 instances of unused code, including functions, global variables, and struct fields, which cleans the codebase and reduces cognitive overhead.
    5.  **Code Style & Quality (`staticcheck`):**
        *   Renamed the `ActionNotImplErr` variable to `ErrActionNotImpl` to conform to Go's error naming conventions.
        *   Simplified code by replacing `strings.Replace` with `strings.ReplaceAll` where appropriate and removing redundant `break` statements from `switch` cases.
*   **Accuracy and Completeness:**
    *   The changes are **accurate**. Each change directly addresses a specific linter warning and adheres to Go best practices. The process was iterative; after fixing the initial set of issues, the linter was re-run multiple times to find and fix any secondary issues (like unused imports or newly created errors) until the codebase was fully clean.
    *   The task was **complete**. The final run of `golangci-lint run ./...` reported "0 issues," confirming that all findings were successfully and comprehensively addressed.

### Conclusion

The code review confirms that all the requested changes were performed **completely and accurately**. The codebase is now compliant with the stricter `golangci-lint` checks, resulting in improved quality, correctness, and maintainability.
