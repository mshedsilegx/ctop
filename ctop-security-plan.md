## Steps to Resolve Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Initial Analysis:** Could not access the provided GitHub Dependabot URL. Proceeded to analyze the local `go.mod` file to identify dependencies.

2. **Dependency Updates:** Attempted to update all Go modules to the latest versions using `go get -u ./...` to address the 49 reported security vulnerabilities.

3. **Build Failures:** The initial updates caused build failures related to breaking changes in the `github.com/opencontainers/runc` and `github.com/cilium/ebpf` dependencies.

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Identified the specific error messages pointing to incompatibilities between `runc` and its transitive dependency, `cilium/ebpf`.
   - Systematically downgraded `runc` to `v1.1.11` and `cilium/ebpf` to `v0.11.0` to find a compatible set of versions.

5. **Verification:** After adjusting the dependency versions, the project's tests passed successfully using `go test ./...`.

6. **Conclusion:** The project's dependencies have been updated, resolving the build errors and likely addressing the reported security vulnerabilities.
